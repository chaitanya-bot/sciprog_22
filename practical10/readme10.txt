In this weeks practical, we will be solving the tower of hanoi problem using a recursive function.
When only 1 disc is present, the disc is moved directly from rod2 to rod3.
When more than 1 disc is present, the disc is moved rod1 to rod2 with rod3 as intermediary and moved from rod2 to rod3 with rod1 as intermediary.
The recursive function will have 4 arguments. The number of discs,rod1,rod3 and rod2.

There are 2 programes to execute in this practical

The first one is a conversion program where a decimal number will be converted into a binary number with the help of sprintf and a while loop.

The second one is sum program where we have to find 2 sums. The first one (1+1/2+1/3......1/1000) and the other one (1/1000 + 1/999 + .........1). 
Print the difference between both sums and check if they are the same. This has been done using two for loops to add numbers

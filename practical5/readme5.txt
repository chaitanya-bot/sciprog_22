In this weeks practical there are 2 programs

1. Fibonacci

Here a function has been used to compute the fibonacci series. it takes f0 anf f1 as initial vlaues.
Then both of them are added. f1 is passed to f0 and the sum is passed to f1.
The program works when a positive number is entered

2. Arctangent

There are 2 functions. The first one is through Maclaurin series. For this delta and x are given as inputs.
Here total will be a summation of x^2n+1/2n+1 
It should be calculated until element value becomes greater than precision

The second function is through natural logarithms. It can be found out using math libraray.

In the main program we are finding out the difference in output between the functions upto 10 decimalm points. for this %.10 is used.

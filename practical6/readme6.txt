In this practical, we will be doing matrix multiplication where the function doing the muliplication will be in one file and the main program will be in another file.
Using nested loops, initialize matrix A and B where A is the sum of row and column number and B is the difference of row and column number.
Then using nested loops, matrix C is calculated.

I have pushed three 3 C files in the directory. Fullprogram.c has the complete code in the same program. main.c and matmult.c are other 2 files which are done according to the practical.

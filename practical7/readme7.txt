In this weeks practical, there are 2 programs.

The 1st program is find to find e^1 using taylor series. Here we are initiializing a dynamic array using malloc. Then to find the value, we need to use both factorial and power. 
The factorial is found out using a for loop and power is taken from the math library. Finally we are printing the difference between e(1) theoretical value and the calue we got from
taylor's series from 1st to 15th polynomial. The difference should reduce as the number of polynomial increases.

The 2nd program has various functions. The 1st one is to allocate memory dynamically to an array and returing it. The 2nd function is to fill the array with all ones. The 3rd function is to 
print the contents of the dynamic array. The 4th function is free memory of the array.

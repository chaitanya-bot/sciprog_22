In this weeks practical, we will be reading a matrix from a file adn check if its magicsquare or not.
The magicsquare function has been provided in the practical. Here M = (n * (n*n + 1))/2 where n is the number of rows/columns of the square matrix.
If our row sum,column sum, main and secondary diagonals sum equals this number then it is a magicsquare.
In our main C file, a function is written to check the dimensions of the square matrix, the matrix is read from the text file and it is passed to the magicsquare function to check if it is magicsquare or not.
I have entered the matrix in matrix.txt file. For the program to work, make sure that matrix.txt is in the same directory as the main.c file.
